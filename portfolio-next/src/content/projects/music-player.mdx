## Overview

This was one of my first interactive projects where I explored working with third-party APIs. I used the Deezer API to fetch music data and render it in a custom UI. The whole experience felt like building my own mini Spotify.

## Approach

I learned how to use external APIs that require API keys and handle their rate limits gracefully. I implemented a custom audio player using the native `audio` tag, which gave me control over play, pause, and seek. For the search functionality, I implemented debouncing to reduce API calls while typing, which helped me understand input optimization. Working with the data returned from the API, I practiced array manipulation and dynamic DOM rendering.
