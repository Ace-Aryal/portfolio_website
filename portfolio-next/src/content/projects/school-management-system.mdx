## Overview

This is my biggest project so farâ€”a full-stack school management system with role-based authentication and advanced data handling. It supports multiple user types like students, teachers, and staff, each with their own dashboard and permissions.

## Approach

I used Shadcn UI for building a clean and functional interface. Appwrite handled all backend logic including database, authentication, storage, and custom server-side logic via functions. React Query helped with fetching paginated data and handling cache. The project includes features like inbox, notices, user registration, attendance management (WIP), and fee billing (planned). A Nepali date picker was added for local calendar support. I even set up CRON-based Appwrite functions for auto-deletion of outdated messages. This app truly feels like building SaaS from scratch.
