# Git Workflow for Junior Developers 🚀

As I was learning git and github I made some notes and created this guide from the notes so that if anyone needs it they can refer to it

This guide outlines the **real-world Git workflow** you’ll follow as a junior dev working in teams. It starts from **cloning a repo**, and covers day-to-day practices, including **pulling**, **rebasing**, **committing**, **handling rejected pull requests**, and **avoiding merge conflicts**.

## 🧭 Step 1: Clone the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/org/project-name.git
cd project-name
```

> 🔍 Make sure you're in the correct working directory (`cd project-name`).

## 🌱 Step 2: Start From a Fresh `main` Branch

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

> ✅ **Always pull the latest `main` before starting new work.** This avoids surprises later.

## 🌿 Step 3: Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feat/user-login
```

> ✍️ **Naming Convention:**

- `feat/` → new feature (`feat/navbar`)
- `fix/` → bug fix (`fix/form-validation`)
- `refactor/` → cleanups (`refactor/home-component`)
- `chore/` → config or minor updates

## 💻 Step 4: Work Locally & Commit Often

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add login form UI with basic validation"
```

### ✅ Commit Best Practices

- Write clear, **atomic** commits (small, focused)
- Use **present tense**: "Add X", not "Added X"
- Avoid meaningless messages: `Update`, `Fix stuff`

> 📌 **Commit frequency**: After every small, testable milestone — even if it’s just styling or a hook.

## 🔁 Step 5: Rebase Before You Push

Before pushing, rebase your feature branch with the latest `main` to prevent conflicts and keep a clean history.

```bash
git pull origin main --rebase
```

> 🔄 Why not `merge`? Rebase avoids cluttered commit history full of merge commits.

## 🚀 Step 6: Push to Remote

```bash
git push origin feat/user-login
```

Then go to GitHub/GitLab and open a Pull Request.

## 📋 Step 7: Open a Pull Request (PR)

1. Go to the repository
2. Compare your branch with `main`
3. Add a **clear title** and **description**
4. Tag reviewers (your team lead or senior dev)

> ✅ Describe what the PR does, and how to test it if needed.

## ❌ Step 8: Rejected PR? Handle Gracefully

If your PR is **rejected or needs changes**:

1. Make the requested edits
2. Commit again
3. Push again — the PR will **update automatically**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: change form validation as per review"
git push
```

> 🔁 Don’t take PR reviews personally — they’re about improving code, not criticizing you.

## 🔀 Step 9: Merge & Cleanup

Once approved and merged (by you or a team member):

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feat/user-login
git push origin --delete feat/user-login
```

> 🧹 Clean up local and remote branches to keep the repo tidy.

## ⚠️ Common Merge Conflict Triggers

- You and another dev edited the **same line** in a file.
- You both added different packages at the same time (causing `package-lock.json` conflicts).
- You didn’t pull latest changes before pushing.
- You auto-formatted files differently (Prettier, ESLint).

### ✅ Conflict Tips

- Use `git status` to see which files are conflicted
- Resolve manually or using VS Code
- After resolving:

```bash
git add .
git rebase --continue
```

## 🛠 Tools That Help

- **VS Code Git UI** — for staging, commits, conflict resolution
- **GitLens extension** — shows who changed what
- **GitHub Desktop / GitKraken** — visual Git clients (optional)
- **Husky + Lint-Staged** — run Prettier/linter before commits

## 🏁 Final Thoughts

Learning Git deeply takes time, but this workflow will help you:

- Collaborate effectively
- Avoid conflicts and messy history
- Grow faster as a team-oriented developer
