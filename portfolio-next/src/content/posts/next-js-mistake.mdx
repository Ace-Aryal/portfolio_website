## ⚛️ Rendering Mistakes

### 1. Using `"use client"` too high in the tree

This makes **all child components** client components — even those that don't need it, which ruins the benefit of server components.

```tsx
// 🚫 Bad: All children become client components
'use client'

export default function Layout({ children }) {
  return <div>{children}</div>
}
```

✅ **Fix:** Only use `"use client"` in components that actually need it (e.g., interactive components using state, effects).

```tsx
// ✅ Good: Only the component that needs interactivity is client
'use client'

export default function Toggle() {
  const [on, setOn] = useState(false)
  return <button onClick={() => setOn(!on)}>{on ? 'ON' : 'OFF'}</button>
}
```

---

### 2. Not refactoring client components

A common habit is dumping `"use client"` on top-level files. Instead:

- Extract the logic into small client components
- Compose them in server components using props or `children`

```tsx
// ServerComponent.tsx
export default function Wrapper({ children }) {
  return <div className="p-4">{children}</div>
}

// ClientComponent.tsx
;('use client')

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  return <button onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}>{count}</button>
}
```

---

### 3. Import location matters

You **can** use client components inside server components. Just **don’t import** them directly. Instead:

✅ Pass them as `children` or load with dynamic imports.

---

### 4. Using client-side state libraries in server components

Libraries like `Redux`, `Zustand`, or `Context` are **client-only**.

✅ Use Next.js tools like `searchParams`, `cookies`, or directly mutate DB state from the server.

---

### 5. Misunderstanding `"use server"`

This does **not** make a component a server component. It **marks a function as a Server Action**.

```ts
'use server'

export async function saveForm(data) {
  // DB logic
}
```

---

### 6. Leaking sensitive data from RSC to RCC

Passing secrets like tokens or credentials as props exposes them to the client.

✅ Keep sensitive logic and data strictly in the server.

---

### 7. Using `localStorage` directly in components

Even client components run once on the server. So:

```tsx
// 🚫 This breaks:
const theme = localStorage.getItem('theme')
```

✅ Use `useEffect()`:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const theme = localStorage.getItem('theme')
}, [])
```

---

### 8. Hydration mismatch

Server HTML and client HTML must match.

✅ Prevent by delaying state-based rendering:

```tsx
const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false)
useEffect(() => setMounted(true), [])
if (!mounted) return null
```

✅ Or use:

```tsx
<Component suppressHydrationWarning />
```

---

### 9. 3rd party libraries using browser APIs

Libraries that use `document`, `window`, etc., will break in SSR.

✅ Use dynamic imports with `ssr: false`:

```tsx
const RichEditor = dynamic(() => import('./RichEditor'), { ssr: false })
```

---

## 🖥️ Server Component Mistakes

### 10. Still using route handlers for everything

You don't need `/api/route` for simple form submissions.

✅ Use Server Actions where possible.

---

### 11. Lifting state unnecessarily

Next.js caches fetches per request. Fetch in multiple places **without prop drilling**.

---

### 12. Waterfall fetching

Avoid sequential fetching of unrelated data.

```ts
// ✅ Use Promise.all
const [posts, users] = await Promise.all([getPosts(), getUsers()])
```

---

### 13. Nested waterfall

Avoid `await` in deep components. Fetch higher and pass down as props.

---

### 14. Data not updating after server action

✅ Use:

```ts
revalidatePath('/dashboard')
```

---

### 15. Submitting forms to RSCs

✅ Use server actions with `<form action={addTodo}>`.

---

### 16. Using server actions in RCC

✅ Possible, but **type arguments as `unknown`** and validate manually.

---

### 17. Not validating data

Always validate on the server too.

✅ Use Zod, Yup, or custom checks.

---

### 18. Using `"use server"` incorrectly

✅ If you're trying to force server-side code, use `server-only` package instead.

---

### 19. Confusing `params` and `searchParams`

- `params`: route segment like `/user/[id]`
- `searchParams`: query string like `?tab=profile`

---

### 20. Not using searchParams for state

URL-based state (filters, tabs) is shareable and cached.

---

### 21. No loading/error UI

✅ Use `loading.tsx`, `error.tsx`, and `<Suspense fallback={...}>`.

---

### 22–24. Suspense misuse

- Be granular.
- Use `key` for dynamic fallback rendering.

```tsx
<Suspense key={slug} fallback={<Skeleton />}>
  <Post slug={slug} />
</Suspense>
```

---

### 25. Accidentally forcing dynamic rendering

Using cookies, `headers()`, or dynamic imports in shared layouts like navbars or footers can make entire app dynamic.

✅ Use `cache: 'force-cache'` where possible.

---

### 26. Hardcoding secrets

✅ Use environment variables and `server-only` package to protect secrets.

```ts
import 'server-only'
const token = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY
```

---

### 27. Mixing server/client logic

✅ Keep folders like:

```
/utils
  /client/useLocalStorage.ts
  /server/db.ts
```

---

### 28. Using `redirect()` inside `try-catch`

✅ Call `redirect()` only **after** your logic. Don't wrap it inside `try/catch`, since it throws internally.

```ts
await doSomething()
redirect('/success') // not in try
```
