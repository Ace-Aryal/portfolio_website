# Web Accessibility

Web accessibility is the practice of making your website usable for **everyone** — from visually impaired users to older adults, users with motor or hearing limitations, and even those in temporary or situational constraints (like using a phone in bright sunlight or with one hand).

Making your site accessible isn’t just a nice-to-have — it’s a **must-have** for real-world usability, ethical design, and even legal compliance.

## 1. 👁️ Visual Accessibility

We must support users with partial vision, color blindness, or age-related difficulties.

- **Label your inputs** clearly. If you don’t want visible labels, use `aria-label`.
- For **toasts and alerts**, use `aria-live="polite"` or `aria-live="assertive"` so screen readers announce them.
- **Contrast ratio** should be **at least 4.5:1**. But don’t go overboard — high contrast shouldn't strain users' eyes.
- Use **DevTools > Rendering > Emulate vision deficiencies** to preview issues.
- Add `alt` attributes to every image — describe the image concisely and informatively.
- Use **semantic HTML** (`<main>`, `<header>`, `<section>`, etc.) so screen readers interpret structure correctly.
- Avoid vague link or button text like "Click here" — use descriptive labels like `"Download Invoice"`, `"Submit Feedback"`.
- Use `em` or `rem` units for font sizes and spacing — they scale better with system font settings.
- If your website has a **contact feature**, offer **both call and text** options.
- Consider adding **light/dark mode** for comfort and contrast flexibility.
- **Test with a screen reader** (NVDA, VoiceOver) or, even better, with users who rely on them.

## 2. ⌨️ Keyboard Accessibility

Many users navigate entirely via keyboard, especially with screen readers or physical limitations.

- Semantic HTML makes most things automatically keyboard-accessible.
- Use `tabIndex="0"` to make a scrollable container focusable.
- Use `tabIndex="-1"` to make an element programmatically focusable but skip it in tab order.
- Ensure **all functionality is usable without a mouse** — no hover-only menus or actions.
- Add a **"Skip to main content"** link for users navigating via Tab through repetitive nav.

## 3. 🔈 Hearing Accessibility

For users with hearing difficulties, ensure all audio content is supported with:

- **Captions** for videos
- **Timestamps** for audio summaries
- **Transcript/Description areas** for video and audio content

## 4. 🖐️ Motor Accessibility

Help users with tremors, limited movement, or assistive devices:

- **Space clickable elements** far enough apart to avoid accidental taps.
- Ensure **buttons are large** enough to interact with comfortably.
- **Avoid timers** or auto-redirects for critical tasks (like form submissions), as not everyone can act quickly.

## 5. 📱 General Accessibility Tips

- If your website functions like a search engine or dashboard, use the `autofocus` attribute on the primary input.
- Make your site **mobile responsive** — it's not just for convenience, it's an accessibility issue for many.

## 🛠️ Bonus: Audit Accessibility

Use **Chrome DevTools > Lighthouse > Accessibility** to:

- Get accessibility scores
- Detect missing ARIA labels
- Spot poor contrast or keyboard traps

## 🎯 Final Thought

Accessibility isn’t a one-time task — it’s a **design mindset**. The more inclusive your UI, the better your site becomes for everyone.

Start small, test often, and always **design for the edge cases** — because for real users, they’re not edge cases at all.
